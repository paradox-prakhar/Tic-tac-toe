## 🧠 Game Logic

- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Each cell can be clicked once to place a mark (X or O).
- After each move, the game checks for a win condition.
- If a player wins, the winning cells are highlighted, and the game-over music plays.
- Clicking the **Reset** button clears the board and restarts the background music.
